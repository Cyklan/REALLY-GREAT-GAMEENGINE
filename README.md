# REALLY GREAT GAMEENGINE

This is the REALLY GREAT GAMEENGINE. It is a game engine built ontop of pixi (the render library), miniplex (the ECS), matter (the physics engine) and tauri (the rust version of electron).

## Setup

To develop (with) the REALLY GREAT GAMEENGINE, you'll need the Bun javascript runtime and the Rust toolchain.

## Features

This is more of a cobbled together framework of libraries to make a game with than an engine, so heres a couple of things that this baby can do

- [x] render images in a browser canvas ðŸ¤¯
- [x] scale and letterbox said canvas automatically
- [x] dynamically import all assets
- [x] physics and collision
- [x] keyboard input!!!
- [x] tweening
- [ ] camera
